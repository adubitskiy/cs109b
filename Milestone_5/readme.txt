submission 1 - unchanged

submission 2 - unchanged

submission 3
- added SGD model based on reduced features (PCA decomposition used)
- improved existing performance visualisation plot (points labelled)
- added new preformance visualistaion plots (easy to compare performance metrics for models / labels)

submission 4
- inception V3 based model changed to support multi-label classification
- both incpetion V3 and custom CNN notebooks fixed to include standard classification reports

new notebooks
- added model_text_cast.ipynb notebook with SVM multi-label model based on the 
  combined plot/cast/crew features and trained on the full dataset (~37K observations)
- added model_compare.ipynb notebook with code to compare performance the 3 models
  (SVM, inception V3 based CNN and the custom CNN).
