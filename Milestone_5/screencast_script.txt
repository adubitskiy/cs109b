Sunny day in Cambridge. A couple of student walking holding hands, obviously in love. She sees a large movie poster; the title is blocked by some ad put over.

She: Darling, I love this actor! Could we please see the move! It must be a very romantic one!
Keenan: I am sorry, honey. I don't like romantic movies. They make me very sleepy.

She: Please, if you love me!
Keenan:  Hmmm. Let me just check something sweetie pie (dialling a number).

Timur: House of data science, Timur speaking.
Keenan: Hi, Timur.

Timur: Hi Keenan. How can I help?
Keenan: Could you please save my love?

Timur: Of course! I am a data scientist, I can save anything.
Keenan: Excellent! Could you please help me to identify a movie genre by the poster.

Timur: Send me the picture (hangs up).

Keenan takes the picture with his mobile phone and sends it to Timur. Almost immediately he receives a text message. Reads it.

Keenan (quietly): It is a romantic comedy.
Keenan (loudly): You know what darling, let’s go and see the movie! I can do it for you.
She: You are my prince!

They are going to the movies. Sounds of a horror movie. Keenan dials a number.

Timur: House of data science, Timur speaking.
Keenan: It was a horror movie, Timur!
Timur: I am sorry, Keenan, the accuracy is not perfect.

The end.
