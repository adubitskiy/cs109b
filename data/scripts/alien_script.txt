<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Did it get on him?

     Standard approaches and peers at Broussard's head.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               No, thank God... just missed him.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               Is it still dripping?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (examining it)
               It appears to have healed itself.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               It makes me sick to see him like
               that.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               Isn't there some way we can get it
               off him?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               I don't see how.  But let's do what
               we can for him.

     Standard presses a button, and Broussard slides back into the
     diagnostic coffin.  He presses more buttons, and the displays light up
     again, showing different parts of Broussard's body.

<b>                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
</b>               I think we'd better get some
               intravenous feeding started.  God
               knows what that thing is leaching
               out of him.

     Standard operates some controls, and the machine begins to invade
     Broussard's body, sliding needles into him.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (studying the screens)
               Look there, what's that stain on his
               lungs?

     The X-ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the vicinity of Broussard's
     chest.  In the center, the stain is completely opaque.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               It appears to be a heavy fluid of
               some sort... it blocks the X-rays... 

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               That tube must be depositing it in
               him.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               Could be some kind of venom, or
               poison... 

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               This is horrible.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Hey!  what about the film?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               What film?

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Broussard had film in his datastick,
               didn't he?  We can see what happened
               to him.

     <u>INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM</u>

     Again we are watching slides in the darkened room.  This time Standard,
     Roby, Melkonis, and Hunter are watching the sequence of photographs
     taken automatically by Broussard's datastick as he probed the tomb.

     The camera reveals the "urns."  The climax of the sequence of stills
     comes when THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE "URN" TOWARD THE CAMERA --
     and after that the camera drops to a useless angle and proceeds to
     show a series of meaningless blurs.  Then the reel ends.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               That must have been when he got it.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               The same thing must've happened to
               the creatures on the other ship... 
               except they took one of those jars
               on board, and opened it there.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>                    (clicks back through the
                     slides to a picture of
                     one of the "urns")
               At first I thought they were jars
               too, or artifacts anyway.  But
               they're not.  They're eggs, or spore
               casings.  Let's go back to the
               heiroglyphics.

     CLICKETYCLICKETYCLICK -- Melkonis accelerates through the slides in a
     blur, stopping at the one he wants -- which shows a strip of
     heiroglyphs on the wall of the tomb.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               I personally can't make any sense
               out of it... 

     CLICK.  CLICK.  Melkonis is changing the slides as they talk, showing
     different angles on the glyphs.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               It's a crude symbolic language --
               looks primitive.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               You can't tell -- that kind of stuff
               could represent printed circuits... 

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               That sounds a little fanciful... 

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               Primitive pictorial languages are
               based on common objects in the
               environment, and this can be used as
               a starting point for translation... 

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               What common objects?

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Listen, hadn't somebody better check
               on Broussard?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (rising)
               I'll do it.  The rest of you
               continue.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>                    (rising)
               I'll come with you.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY</u>

     Standard and Hunter come down the passageway.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               You know, it's fantastic -- the
               human race has gone this long
               without ever encountering another
               advanced life form, and now we run
               into a veritable zoo.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               What do you mean?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Well, those things out there aren't
               the same, you know -- the spaceship
               and the pyramid.  They're from
               different cultures and different
               races.  That ship just landed here --
               crashed like we did.  The pyramid and
               the thing from it are indigenous.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               How could anything be indigenous to
               this asteroid?  It's dead.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Maybe it wasn't always dead.

     They arrive at the infirmary.

     <u>INTERIOR - INFIRMARY</u>

     The door slides open, and they step into the room.  Hunter activates
     the bed, and it slides out of the wall.

<b>     THERE IS A LONG, HORRIFIED PAUSE.
</b>
<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               It's gone.

     They rush to Broussard's prone form.  THE PARASITE IS GONE FROM HIS
<b>     FACE.
</b>
     Broussard is still unconscious, but he is breathing.  HIS FACE IS
<b>     COVERED WITH SUCKER MARKS.
</b>
<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Now we're in for it.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               The door was closed.  It must still
               be in here.

     They immediately grow very tense.  Hunter starts edging toward the
     door.  Standard grabs his arm.

<b>                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
</b>               No, don't open the door.  We don't
               want it escaping.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>                    (very nervous)
               Well, what the hell good can we do
               in here?  We can't grab it -- it
               might jump on us --

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Maybe we can catch it.

     Standard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid.

<b>                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
</b>               As long as we're careful not to
               damage it... 

     Tray in one hand, lid in the other, Standard begins moving slowly
     around the room.  There are very few places to hide.

     He bends down and peers under the bunk.

     As he is down on his hands and knees, WE SEE ONE TENTACLE OF THE
<b>     THING, VIBRATING ON A LEDGE JUST ABOVE STANDARD.
</b>
     He rises, and HIS SHOULDER BRUSHES THE TENTACLE.  THE PARASITE DROPS TO
<b>     THE FLOOR.
</b>
<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (leaping back)
               Shit!

     But the thing is not moving.  It lies motionless on the floor, its
     tentacles curled up.  Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey.

     Without taking his eyes off the thing, Standard reaches behind him and
     takes a long probe from the wall.  He prods the thing; it does not
     respond.

<b>                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
</b>               I think it's dead.

     With great care, he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasite
     into the tray.  Then he quickly closes the lid.

     <u>INTERIOR - LABORATORY</u>

     Standard, Roby, and Melkonis have the parasite spread-eagled on a
     stainless steel table, with a bright light on it.  It is belly-side up.

     Wearing gloves, Standard probes at the thing with an instrument.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Look at these suckers -- no wonder
               we couldn't get it off him.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Is that its mouth?

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               More likely that organ -- the tube-
               like thing -- fits up in there.

     With a pair of needle-nosed pliers, Standard fishes in the fleshy
     aperture.  Carefully, he extracts the end of the tube-organ.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Ugh.

     Suddenly, it starts to FALL APART IN THE PLIERS.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Quick -- it's decomposing -- gimme
               something to grab it with!

     It begins to SMOKE AND BUBBLE.

     Roby grabs a long pair of tongs from the wall and thrusts them at
     Standard -- who throws down the pliers, snatches the tongs and seizes
     the thing in the tongs.

     It is smouldering and dripping acid on the floor.

<b>                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
</b>               Christ!  Let's get it out of here!

     Carrying the thing, he heads for the door.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP</u>

     The men run down the passageways, Standard carrying the dripping thing
     in the tongs.  It leaves little smoking droplets on the floor.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK</u>

     They come running up to the airlock.  Roby stabs the button and the
     inner door slides open.  By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby is
     already on the intercom:

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (shouts into intercom)
               For Chrissake, open the main lock!

     <u>INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY</u>

     Roby stumbles in as the inner door closes; and with a heavy whine, the
     thick surface door rumbles open.  Orange sunlight billows in, followed
     by the inevitable dust.

     Standard HURLS THE CARCASS OUT, tongs and all.

     <u>EXTERIOR - BASE OF SHIP - DAY</u>

     The parasite hits the ground and begins to sink into the dust,
     smouldering and fuming.

     <u>INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY</u>

     The outer door rolls shut.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (slumping against the
                     wall)
               My God, it's lethal even when it's
               dead!

     Melkonis gets down on his knees and studies the small burn-holes in
     the floor.

     Standard opens the inner door and steps out into the corridor.  There,
     he activates the wall intercom and punches out a combination.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK</u>

<b>                              HUNTER

               Yes?

<b>                              STANDARD

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>                    (over, filtered)
               He's running a fever.

</b>                    (over, filtered)
               The machine will bring his
               temperature down.  His vital
               functions are strong.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Good.

     He switches off the intercom.

<b>                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
</b>                    (suddenly exhausted)
               I need some coffee.

     He turns and walks away.

     <u>INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM</u>

     The cat is strolling around as Roby and Melkonis drop into seats;
     Standard draws a cup of coffee from the machine.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               These day and night cycles are
               totally disorienting.  I feel like
               we've been here for days, but it's
               only been how long?

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (stroking the cat)
               About four hours.

               I'm sorry to say it looks like you
               were right in the first place,
               Martin.  We never should have landed
               here.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Look, I'm not trying to rub
               anybody's nose in anything.  The
               important thing is just to get away
               from here as fast as possible.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               I can't lean on Faust any harder --
               he's been working non-stop on the
               engines.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               If we knew exactly what happened to

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               We do know that.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Yeah?

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               They never made it off the planet.
               The parasites won.

     This brings a CHILLY SILENCE.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Where did the parasites come from?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               They seem native to the planet.  It's
               got an atmosphere and a dense
               gravity.  It's dead now, but once it
               must have been fertile.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               No.  It's just too small to support
               fauna as big as the parasites.  If
               there were a native ecology, it
               would have to be microscopic.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Couldn't the pyramid have been built
               here by space travellers?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Too primitive.  It's a pre-
               technological construction.  That
               slab was engineered by an Iron-Age
               culture at best.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               They're from a dead civilization;
               they're spores from a tomb.  God

     Suddenly the door opens and Faust sticks his head in.  He is covered
     with dirt and grime.

     <u>EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY</u>

     The SNARK's engines cough and then with a ROAR BEGIN TO BELCH OUT
     STREAMS OF SUPERHEATED AIR, cutting through the tulgy dust.

     The ship roars and vibrates like a huge beast, capable of unlimited
     power.

     <u>INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY</u>

     They are all at their posts.

     There is a hair-tingling ELECTRICAL HUM which permeates the whole

     The pitch of the engines changes, deepens.

     <u>EXTERIOR - SKY - DAY</u>

     The SNARK swoops up at an acute angle into the boiling clouds.
     Visibility is zero.

     <u>INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM</u>

     Faust is pulling on a gasmask, because the engine chamber is beginning
     to fill with dust.  He turns on a huge exhaust unit which begins to
     suck up some of the dust.

     <u>INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY</u>

     On the screens, nothing but clouds.  Then, ANOTHER TREMOR SHUDDERS
     THROUGH THE SHIP.  The men no longer speak; their expressions are grim,
     set, and sweating; they are watching their instruments.  Periodically
     they mutter technical instructions to each other.

     <u>EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY</u>

     Abruptly the ship CLEARS THE TOP OF THE CLOUD LAYER AND BURSTS OUT
     INTO STAR-SPRINKLED SPACE, trailing a wake of dust behind it.

     <u>EXTERIOR - SHIP AT LIGHT SPEED - LATER</u>

     The ship's speed is so great that there is perceptible movement in the
     universe all around.

     There is a strange corona effect which causes the stars approaching
     the ship to appear blue, and the receding ones to be red.  This is
     redshift, made visible because of their incredible velocity.

     <u>INTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE</u>

     They are unstrapping.

     As they walk along.

</b>               I think the best thing to do with
               Broussard is to just freeze him as
               he is.  It'll arrest the progress of
               his disease, and he can get complete
               medical attention when we get back
               to the Colonies.

<b>                              ROBY

               treat him.

     They enter the infirmary.

     <u>INTERIOR - INFIRMARY</u>

     As they enter the room, THEY ARE SHOCKED TO SEE BROUSSARD SITTING UP
     in BED -- AWAKE.

<b>                              BROUSSARD

               ... Mouth's so dry... can I have some
               water... 

     Instantly, Roby brings him a plastic cup of water.  Broussard gulps it
     down in a swallow.

<b>                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
</b>               More.

     Roby quickly fills a much bigger container and hands it to Broussard,
     who greedily consumes the entire thing.  Then he sags, panting, on the
     bunk.

<b>                              STANDARD

               remember my name.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Are you in pain?

<b>                              BROUSSARD

               somebody's been beating me with
               rubber hoses for about six years.

     Melkonis laughs at this remark.  Broussard smiles faintly at him.

</b>               Hell, you're in great shape, you've

               I think that's a pretty reasonable
               request.

     <u>INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM</u>

     The entire crew is seated around the table, eating huge portions
     greedily.  The cat eats from a dish on the table.

<b>                              HUNTER

     He clutches the edge of the table with his hands, his knuckles
     whitening.

     Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he is
     trembling violently from head to foot.

<b>     A RED SMEAR OF BLOOD BLOSSOMS ON THE CHEST OF BROUSSARD'S TUNIC.

     Everybody SCREAMS and leaps back from the table.  The cat spits and
     bolts.

     The disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of Broussard's
     chest trailing a thick, wormlike tail -- splattering fluids and blood
     -- lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table -- and
     scurries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground.

     When they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped.
     Broussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest,
     spouting blood.  The dishes are scattered and the food is covered with
     blood and slime.

<b>                              HUNTER

     <u>EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE</u>

     A hatch slides open on the side of the ship, and Broussard's wrapped
     body tumbles silently out.

     AN ELECTRONIC BASS DRUM BEATS A DIRGE as Broussard drifts into
     eternity.

</b>               And then we run out of food and
               oxygen.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               The water will still recycle.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               We won't need it then.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               All right, so that's what we've got.
               A week.  It's plenty of time.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               But if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a
               week, then we have to go into the
               freezers anyway.

     They enter the bridge.

     <u>INTERIOR - BRIDGE</u>

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               So does anybody have any
               suggestions?

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               We could put on our pressure suits
               and blow all the air out of the
               ship.  That would kill it.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               No, we can't afford to lose that
               much oxygen.  We're going to have to
               flush it out.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               How?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Room by room, corridor by corridor.

     No one likes this thought.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               And what do we do when we find it?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we
               had a really strong piece of net, we
               could bag it.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               We could cut a section out of that
               metallite netting.  It won't hold up
               to that acid, but aside from that
               it's pretty strong.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               We have to avoid injuring it.  What
               we really need is some electric
               animal prods.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               I think I could cobble something
               together.  A long metal rod with a
               battery in it.  Give it a hell of a
               shock.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm
               issuing a standing order: from this
               moment forth, every one of us will
               wear protective garments, including
               helmets.  Let's get down to the
               locker and change.

     They start for the exit.

     <u>EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE</u>

     The SNARK continues on its way through the weird vortex of hyperspace.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP</u>

     Standard is walking purposefully along the corridor, alone.  He is
     garmented in an unusual outfit which makes him look like a riot
     policeman, including clear plastic helmet.

     He reaches a corner and turns.  But this new passageway has a different
     gravity orientation -- Standard seems to be walking down a vertical
     wall.

     He makes yet another disorienting turn, and now he is walking upside-
     down.  He reaches a set of steps and climbs up them -- or rather, down
     them.

     <u>INTERIOR - VENTRAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE</u>

     Melkonis is seated in the dome, upside-down, peering down into space.
     He also wears the protective suit.

     Standard, upside-down, climbs into the dome.  It is dark and eerie
     here, under the stars of interstellar space.  A few glowing panels
     provide the only illumination.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               I thought I'd find you here.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               I was thinking of a line from an old
               poem: "Water, water everywhere, but
               not a drop to drink."  All that space
               out there, and we're trapped in this
               ship.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               That's the one about the albatross,
               right?

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               We can't even radio for help; the
               carrier wave wouldn't reach its
               destination till long after we'd
               died and turned to dust.  We are
               utterly, absolutely alone.  Can
               anybody really visualize such a
               scale of distances?  Halfway across
               Creation... 

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               We came out there, we'll go back.  A
               long time by the clock, but a short
               time to us.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               Time and space have no meaning out
               here.  We're living in Einsteinian
               equation.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               I can see you're putting your spare
               time to good use.
                    (leans forward and taps
                     him on the knee)
               Let me tell you something: you keep
               staring at hyperspace for long
               enough, they'll be peeling you off a
               wall.  I've seen it happen.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>                    (smiles at him)
               We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We
               even have our own special diseases.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Come on -- let's go above and see
               how they're coming with the gear.

     <u>INTERIOR - BRIDGE</u>

     The whole crew has assembled.  Faust is unfolding several yards of
     shimmering metallic netting.

     Hunter hands out five thin rods, like metal broom handles.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               These have portable generators in
               them.  They're insulated down to here
               -- just be careful not to touch the
               end.

     He demonstrates by touching the tip of one of the rods to a metal
     object.  A blue spark leaps.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               Might even incinerate the damn
               thing.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (sharply)
               I hope not.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Don't worry, it won't damage it,
               it'll just give it a little
               incentive.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               How do we locate the creature?

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               With these.

     He picks up a small portable unit.

<b>                              FAUST (CONT'D)
</b>               Tracking device.  You set it to
               search for a moving object... It
               hasn't got much range, but when you
               get within a certain distance, it
               starts beeping.

     Standard takes the device and studies it.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               These will be very useful.  At least
               we won't have to go digging around
               in closets with our bare hands.  All
               right, here's the battle plan: we're
               going to break into two teams and
               start systematically covering the
               ship.  Whoever finds it first,
               catches it in the net and ejects it
               from the nearest airlock.  Clear?

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Even simple.

     Standard shoots him a vicious look, then continues:

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               For starters, let's make sure the
               bridge is safe.

     Faust takes the device and turns it on.  He scans it around the room.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               It's clear.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               All right -- Roby and Melkonis will
               go with Faust.  Hunter and I will
               make up the second team.

     They start doling out the equipment.

<b>                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
</b>               We'll all carry communicators.  We
               want to keep in constant touch.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP</u>

     Melkonis and Roby carry the net, while Faust walks directly behind it,
     carrying the tracking device.  He continually scans it from side to
     side.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               Nothing yet... nothing... we can move
               pretty fast as long as there's
               nothing on the tracker.

     <u>INTERIOR - OTHER CORRIDORS</u>

     Standard and Hunter move silently along.  Standard is forced to serve a
     double function, carrying one edge of the net and the tracker as well.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS</u>

     Roby's team is moving at a fairly brisk pace, when:

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               Hold it.

     Faust's tracker is BEEPING, and a small light flashes.

<b>                              FAUST (CONT'D)
</b>               I've got something.

     Immediately, they grow very tense and start looking around.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Where's it coming from?

<b>                              FAUST
</b>                    (peers closely at tracker
                     and frowns)
               Machine's screwed up, I can't tell.
               Needle's spinning all over the dial.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               Is it malfunctioning?

     Faust turns the tracker on its side, and the needle stabilizes.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               No, just confused.  It's coming from
               below us.

     They all look down at their feet.

     <u>INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL</u>

     Roby, Melkonis, and Faust come carefully down a set of crude metal
     stairs, into a drab, functional section of the ship.

     The corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in the
     ceiling.  The effect is ugly and confining.

     They stop at the foot of the stairs and move into position, spreading
     the net across the corridor.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Okay.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>                    (looking at tracker and
                     nodding down the passageway)
               That way.

     They begin to walk down the passageway, footsteps clanging on the raw
     metal flooring.  It is extremely dark.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               What happened to the lights?

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to
               replace 'em.

     They switch on the helmet lights.

<b>     CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AROUND A COUPLE OF TURNINGS, AND THEN:
</b>
<b>                              FAUST (CONT'D)
</b>               Hold it.

     They all stop quickly, almost stumbling.

<b>                              FAUST (CONT'D)
</b>                    (whispering)
               It's within 4 meters.

     Roby and Melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand.  Faust,
     prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of
     approaching the source of the signal.

     He moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any
     second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker.

     The tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one
     wall.

     Behind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down Faust's face as he sets
     down the tracker and reaches for the little door.  He raises the prod,
     grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod
     inside.

<b>     WITH A NERVE-SHATTERING SQUALL, A SMALL CREATURE COMES FLYING OUT OF
</b><b>     THE CABINET, EYES GLARING, CLAWS FLASHING.
</b>
     Instinctively, they throw the net over it, but:

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (very annoyed)
               Oh, hold it!

     They open the net and release the creature.  IT IS THE CAT.  Hissing and
     spitting, it scampers away.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               We're making fools of ourselves!

     Roby's COMMUNICATOR BEEPS.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (into communicator)
               Yes!

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (over, filtered)
               We've got it up here!  It's trapped!
               Get up here fast!

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Where are you?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (over, filtered)
               Food-storage room!

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               We're coming!

     They dash for the stairs.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP</u>

     Roby, Faust, and Melkonis charge down the hallways until they arrive
     at:

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD STORAGE ROOM</u>

     Standard and Hunter are waiting for them, in hysterics.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               We saw it inside and slammed the
               door on it!  It's in there now!

     On the other side of the door, CRASHING AND BANGING can be heard.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               What's it doing, having a seizure?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               It started crashing around right
               after we locked it in.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Now what?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               I guess we open the door and net it.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               I hate to open that door.

     Again the thing can be heard CRASHING AROUND INSIDE.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               It looks completely different from
               the first one -- it's more like a
               worm with legs... and tentacles.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               Well we better do something.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped
               in there.  We could just leave it in
               there all the way back to Irth.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (snaps)
               Don't be an idiot.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               I know what we can do.  We can pump
               poison gas into the room and kill
               it.  Through those ventilator slots
               there.

     He indicates a row of slots in the bottom of the door.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our
               food supplies in there!  We can't
               pump poison gas all over them!

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Once we kill the thing we won't need
               the food any more -- we can go
               straight into hypersleep.  Also, it
               sounds like that thing is already
               doing a pretty good job on our
               supplies; it may be fouling them
               all.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD LOCKER - LATER</u>

     CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT they are fastening a large funnel-
     shaped device over the ventilator grill at the bottom of the door.
     This funnel is attached to a thick hose, which runs back to a large
     metal tank with pressure gauges.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Get those masks on.

     They pull on gas masks.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               This stuff's deadly -- I hope we
               know what we're doing.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Go ahead, Jay.

     Faust turns on the machine.  It begins to throb as it pumps the gas
     through the hose and into the room.

     Immediately, THE CRASHING NOISES RISE IN CRESCENDO, AND THE THING CAN
<b>     BE HEARD SCREECHING AND SQUEALING.
</b>
     Then the sounds stop altogether.

<b>                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
</b>               Shut it off.

     Faust shuts off the pump.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Now what?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               What do you think?  Now we go in.

     Standard steps to the door and opens it.  A thick cloud of gas billows
     out.

     <u>INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM</u>

     The room is thick with the poison gas.  The men look like insects in
     their gasmasks.

     The food packages are ripped to shreds, and foodstuffs are scattered
     all over the floor.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               Looks like he helped himself.

     Carefully, the men poke through the garbage, net and prods raised.

     Then Hunter points.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               God damn it.

     They all look where he is pointing.  In the wall, A VENTILATOR GRILL
<b>     HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN.
</b>
<b>                              HUNTER (CONT'D)
</b>               It escaped.

     They move to the shredded ventilator and shine their lights into it.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Where does that go?

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               All over the ship; we'll have to
               check the charts to know for sure.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Then let's go and do it.

     They head for the door.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Have we got any food at all left in
               the ship?

     They slam the door shut and seal it.

     <u>INTERIOR - BRIDGE</u>

     The screens are showing them a schematic of the ship's system of
     ventilator shafts.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               That one section of the ventilator
               shaft has only two outlets -- you
               notice?  The food storage room on one
               end --

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               -- And the cooling unit on the
               other.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               So it's trapped in between -- now we
               have to drive it out.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               Poison gas... 

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               We can't pump poison gas down into
               the cooling unit!  It'll flood the
               whole ship!

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               The only other thing I can think of
               is for somebody to crawl in there
               and flush it out.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Are you <u>crazy</u>?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               The man would need protection,
               obviously -- as well as some way to
               drive the thing before him.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               How about a flamethrower?  That
               wouldn't poison the air.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               So one of us goes into the airshaft
               and drives the thing along --

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               While the rest of us wait down in
               the cooling unit with the net.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Sounds like a rough one.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Got a better idea?

     Hunter shrugs.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               So the only question left is: who
               gets to crawl down the airshaft?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Let's be democratic.

     He tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console.  On one
     of them, he draws a large X.  Then he wads each piece of paper into a
     tiny little ball.

     He rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the table
     like dice.

<b>                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
</b>               Martin, take one.

     Roby picks one up and unfolds it.  It is blank.

     Melkonis picks up another and opens it.  Again blank.

     Faust picks up a ball, and Standard immediately picks his own up.  They
     are both blank.

     They all look at Hunter, who has not yet unfolded his.

<b>                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
</b>               Open it up, Cleave.

     <u>INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM</u>

     Hunter is strapping on an oxygen mask and a flame thrower.  Faust is
     helping him.

     Finally, Faust hands him a tracking device.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you
               won't need me, but if you do, I'm
               here.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>                    (grimly)
               Right.

     Hunter turns and climbs into the ventilator opening, which is just
     large enough to crawl through.

     <u>INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT</u>

     It is completely dark in the shaft.  Hunter reaches up and turns on his
     helmet light.  Then he switches on his radio.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Hey, do you guys read me down there?

     <u>INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM</u>

     Standard, Melkonis and Roby are spreading out the net.  We hear the hum
     of huge cooling plants, and their hair ruffles.  Large airshafts run
     off in different directions.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Yeah, we're getting into position.

     <u>INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT</u>

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Okay, I'm starting now.

     He begins to crawl forward into the narrow metal tunnel.  He turns a
     corner.

     After a couple more tight turns, THE TRACKER SUDDENLY BEEPS.

     Hunter twitches.  He raises his flamethrower and FIRES A BLAST INTO THE
     DARKNESS.  It roars loudly in the confined tube, and the air instantly
     heats up.  Smoke drifts back into his face.  He begins to sweat.

     <u>INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM</u>

     Roby points to a large rectangular opening in one wall.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (pointing)
               There.  That's where it's got to come
               out.

     He throws a switch, and a large metal panel rises and seals off the
     opening.

<b>                              ROBY (CONT'D)
</b>               That's a flip-flop gate to channel
               the air, but we can use it to trap
               the thing.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Right now let's keep it closed.

     Melkonis is setting up a little portable unit with a screen on it.  The
     screen shows a section of the ship's schematic.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               I've got Hunter... and something else
               as well, in front of him.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Are they close?

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               They're on the next level up.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Let's get moving with this net.

     They lift the net up, holding it in front of the opening.

     <u>INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT</u>

     Hunter is still crawling on hands and knees.  Up ahead, he can see that
     the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn.

     He crawls toward the down angle, then fires another blast from his
     flamethrower.

     Then he starts crawling down, head first.

     When he is nearly upside-down, the shaft takes yet another turning
     which puts him into a nearly impossible position, almost immobilized.

     Then the tracker starts BEEPING LIKE CRAZY.

     Frantically, he fumbles the flamethrower around, but the space is
     narrow -- it is difficult maneuvering.  He hears a HISSING CRY up
     ahead, and claws scrambling on metal.

     Then he has the weapon into position, and sprays another lethal
     flaming burst toward the sound.

     <u>INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM</u>

     Melkonis is staring at his screen.

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               They're getting pretty close now.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               All right, then -- when it gets to
               the other side of the door, you sing
               out, then drop the door.  Okay?

<b>                              MELKONIS
</b>               Okay.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (to Roby)
               And you and I will bag it, and then
               we'll take it to the ventral air
               lock, got it?

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (tensely)
               Uh-huh.

     <u>INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT</u>

     Hunter is huddled against a wall of the shaft, clutching the
     flamethrower.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>                    (whispers)

</b>                    (whispering)
               I don't think this shaft goes on too
               much farther... anyway it's getting
               pretty hot in here... 

     <u>INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM</u>

               Okay, our screens show you as being
               near to the opening.  We'll open it
               up, then we'll cue you and you can
               start blasting.  That'll drive it
               right out.  You don't have to go any
               farther.

     <u>INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT</u>

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Good.

     He readies the flamethrower.

     <u>INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM</u>

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Okay, get ready.

     He and Roby heft their respective ends of the net, crouched to catch
     the small creature when it darts out.  Melkonis picks up his electric
     prod.

<b>                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
</b>               Open the vent, Sandy.

     Melkonis reaches over and throws the switch.  The metal gate drops
     down, opening up the shaft.

<b>     A SIX-FOOT MONSTROSITY STANDS IN THE OPENING.  GHASTLY BEYOND
</b><b>     IMAGINATION, SQUAMOUS, COVERED WITH TENTACLES, IT HOPS DOWN LIKE AN
</b><b>     OVER-SIZED BIRD AND GRABS MELKONIS IN RAZOR-SHARP TENTACLES.
</b>
     Melkonis lets out a horrible shriek, and the thing grabs his head in
     one claw and TWISTS IT OFF LIKE A MAN PULLING THE HEAD OFF A CHICKEN,
     THEN THROWS IT TO THE FLOOR WITH AN AUDIBLE <u>CLUNK</u>.

<b>     CLUTCHING MELKONIS' BODY TIGHTLY AGAINST ITSELF, IT TURNS AND BOUNDS
</b><b>     DOWN THE HALL.  MELKONIS' HEADLESS BODY IS STILL KICKING AND STRUGGLING
</b><b>     AS THE MONSTER LEAPS HEAD-FIRST INTO ANOTHER AIR SHAFT.
</b>
     Standard and Roby are left standing in shock.  After a moment, Hunter
     climbs out of the shaft.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               What happened?  Where is it?

     They break from their paralysis, and run toward the opening the
     creature just leaped into.  It is another shaft, going down into
     darkness.

<b>                              STANDARD

     <u>INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM</u>

     Faust is still waiting.

<b>                              FAUST

<b>                              FAUST

     Faust lets himself out of the food storage room and carefully locks
     the door behind him.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS</u>

     Standard, Roby and Hunter are rapidly ascending toward the bridge.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               You mean his body was still kicking

     Standard, Roby and Hunter enter and drop into chairs.  Faust follows
     shortly.  They all look blank, stunned.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               No, I don't want us separated.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               You just sealed it off; it can't get
               to that section.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Don't count on it.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               We sure need this flamethrower.

<b>                              STANDARD

<b>                              FAUST
</b>               Right.
                    (heads for the door)

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               And be right back.

	Faust exits.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               I think it's time we took a hard
               look at those heiroglyphs.

     Roby begins to punch buttons; the photographs of the heiroglyphics
     appear on some of the screens.

<b>                              ROBY (CONT'D)
</b>               Can you make out any pattern in all
               that?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (baffled)
               Well... yes... there's a pattern... but
               it's meaningless to me.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               I know it looks like a senseless
               jumble, but if you look closely,
               there are recognizable forms.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Recognizable!  In that?

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               In symbolic form... very stylized... 
               but if you stare at it, you can see
               some of the different creatures
               we've been dealing with.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Well... I suppose that star-shaped
               thing could be the parasite that got
               on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               And right next to it, that oval
               design with the markings -- it's a
               dead ringer for the spore casings.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               That next thing there -- six legs,
               tentacles -- that's the thing we saw
               in the food locker.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               So the next step should be --

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               -- The big one.  And there it is.

     Out of meaningless geometric symbols on a wall, it has become possible
     to recognize each stage in the alien's life cycle.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               This is all the same creature.  We're
               seeing the different stages in its
               life-cycle.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Then that tomb... must have been some
               kind of fertility temple... where
               they stored their eggs, and maybe
               held mating rituals... 

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               ... And Broussard got caught in their
               reproductive cycle.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               You will notice, though, that there
               are no more phases.  Only four forms
               are shown.  After that the pattern
               repeats.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Which presumably means... 

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               ... More spores coming.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK</u>

     Faust quickly turns a couple of corners and then comes to an abrupt
     halt when he notices that a DOOR LEADING TO THE LOWER DECKS HAS BEEN
<b>     WRENCHED OFF ITS HINGES.
</b>
     He hesitates, uncertain what to do, then there is A SOUND FROM THE
<b>     DIRECTION OF THE AIR LOCK... AND THE INNER LOCK DOOR IS OPEN.
</b>
     Faust hesitates and peers into the lock.

     <u>INTERIOR - AIR LOCK</u>

     The creature is squatting in the middle of the floor, gnawing on a
     bloody thigh bone.  It does not see Faust.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK</u>

     Stealthfully, dropping back into the shadows, Faust presses the wall
     intercom and speaks into it.

<b>                              FAUST
</b>                    (whispering)
               It's in the lock -- blow the main
               lock.

     <u>INTERIOR - BRIDGE</u>

     Standard, Roby and Hunter are staring at the pictures.  The call from
     Faust catches Standard in mid-sentence.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (into intercom)
               What?

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK</u>

<b>                              FAUST
</b>                    (whispering)
               It's in the main air lock.  Blow the
               lock.

     <u>INTERIOR - BRIDGE</u>

     Standard hesitates, starts to frame a reply -- then changes his mind
     and runs to his console -- and THROWS THE SWITCH.

     <u>INTERIOR - AIR LOCK</u>

     With a mechanical whine, the inner door starts to close.  The creature
     hears it and INSTANTANEOUSLY LEAPS OUT OF THE LOCK.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK</u>

     The creature comes flying out of the lock and DEALS FAUST A BACK-
<b>     HANDED BLOW, KNOCKING HIM ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE AIR LOCK DOOR.
</b>
<b>     FAUST SCREAMS IN MORTAL AGONY AS THE INNER DOOR CLOSES ON HIS WAIST,
</b>     crushing him to a thickness of about three inches.

     On the wall, a green light goes on:

<b>                         "INNER DOOR CLOSED"
</b>
     <u>INTERIOR - AIR LOCK</u>

     Despite the fact that the inner door is still held open a few inches
     by Faust's squashed body, THE OUTER DOOR BEGINS TO SLIDE OPEN.
<b>     IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS A TREMENDOUS SCREAM OF ESCAPING AIR.
</b>
     <u>EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE</u>

     In dead silence, a thick spurt of steam comes out of the open air lock
     door.  This is the ship's atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into
     the vacuum under pressure.

     <u>INTERIOR - BRIDGE</u>

     INSTANTLY, A TREMENDOUS WINDSTORM STARTS UP as the ship's air is
     sucked out toward the lock.

<b>     A SIREN BEGINS TO SOUND, AND A RED LIGHT FLASHES:
</b>
<b>                         "CRITICAL DEPRESSURIZATION"
</b>
     After a moment of panic and confusion, Roby bolts out of the control
     room.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS</u>

     Loose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways,
     as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along
     by the air current.

     <u>EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE</u>

     A huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds
     of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS</u>

     Whipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt
     against a wall.  As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance,
<b>     HE SEES THE CREATURE SCURRYING AWAY DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR.
</b>
     Ignoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running
     again.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK</u>

     Roby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the
     hall down from the airlock.  Here, the wind is really terrific -- his
     clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound
     is a DEAFENING WHISTLE.

     Instantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a
     sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor.  As the hatch
     closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT.

     Done in, he collapses to the floor.

     Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath.  Because of
     the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD --
     THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE.  Roby is gasping loudly, but we can
     barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking
     underwater.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS</u>

     Clutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and
     Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping
     like fishes out of water.  They are sweating heavily and their noses
     bleed.

     They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can
     only hear distant croaks.

     Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall.  The others
     follow him.

     <u>INTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOM</u>

     The door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging
     thinly on the metal flooring.  We see several rows of large oxygen
     tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks.

     Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening
     them.  THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL
     GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the
     floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully.

     Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               How much oxygen did we lose?

     Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               We've got six hours left.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>                    (groans)
               Oh my God.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Does anybody know what happened?

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed
               in the air lock door.  His body held
               it open.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Can we get to him?

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               No, I had to seal off a whole
               section.  We'd lose too much of our
               remaining air if we opened the
               connecting door.

     <u>INTERIOR - AIR LOCK</u>

     Faust's body, crushed in the inner door, floats weightlessly in the
     vacuum.  His nose and mouth are crusted with huge gobs of dried blood.

     <u>INTERIOR - BRIDGE</u>

     The three survivors -- Standard, Roby and Hunter -- slump into chairs.

     The cat emerges from a hiding place, yowling with fear.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (picking up the cat)
               Poor kitty; puss puss puss.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               At least we're rid of the damn
               monster.  It must have been the first
               thing sucked out of the ship.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               No such luck.  I saw it running down
               one of the corridors.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>                    (groans)
               Oh no!  We can't fight this thing!
               There's only six hours of air left
               -- we're dead men!

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               I don't buy that.  There's still time
               to destroy it and get ourselves in
               the freezers.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               <u>How</u>?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               It's time for drastic remedies.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               It was time for that a couple days
               ago.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               That kind of remark is pointless.
               Now come on -- I want to hear every
               suggestion you can come up with, no
               matter how wild.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               We can't kill it on board.  It's huge
               now and must have tremendous amounts
               of that acid in its body.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               I've got an idea, but you're not
               going to like it.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Let's hear it.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Okay.  First we shut down all the
               cooling systems on the stardrive
               engines.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               That'll blow the ship up.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Right... but it'll take a few minutes
               for the engines to overheat and melt
               down the core.  In the meantime, we
               get in the lifeboat and leave the
               ship.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Blow the ship up?

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               And the creature with it.  We can
               make it back to Irth in the
               lifeboat.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               But the lifeboat can't accelerate to
               light speed.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Doesn't matter -- we're already at
               light speed.  And when we get back to
               the Colonies, they'll pick us up in
               the network.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               What about all the minerals and
               elements in the cargo hold?  That's
               the only reason we came out here.
               We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd
               be broke.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Our lives are more important.
               Anyway, we can take a small amount
               of the most valuable stuff with us
               on the lifeboat.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               No, it won't work and I just
               realized why.  There's only one
               hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat.
               Only one of us could survive.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Yeah... I forgot.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               But the idea's good, if we could
               just turn it around somehow.

     They think.

<b>                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
</b>               If we could just get the <u>creature</u>
               into the lifeboat, we could launch
               it into space and blow it up.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Good!  That's good!

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               We can load the lifeboat up with
               explosives and trigger them
               remotely, once the lifeboat is in
               space.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               I think it's going to be almost
               impossible to drive it up into the
               lifeboat.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               We can use the flamethrower.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               It's not going to work.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               You can't say that; I think it's a
               good plan.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               The flamethrower needs more fuel.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Right.  We've got a lot to
               accomplish.  Let's get moving.

     <u>INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY</u>

     The three men come down steps into this rather dirty area of the ship.
     A lot of tools and large items of machinery are stored around.

<b>     LONG RACKS OF SHELVES ARE STOCKED WITH METAL CONTAINERS OF VARIOUS
</b>     SHAPES.  Each container is well packed and labelled.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Which explosive should we use?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               I'd suggest the N-13 sticks.  They're
               portable, and they can be radio
               detonated.

     Hunter begins to unlock a locker and draw out long, red sticks like
     broomhandles, with tiny printing on them.

     Meanwhile, ROBY IS STARING AT THE ROWS OF METAL CANNISTERS.  He touches
     one of them.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               You know, it's funny -- this stuff
               we went to so much trouble to dig up
               -- this treasure, the paydirt --
               it'll make it back to Irth just fine
               -- even if we're not with it.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Here, carry these.

     Hunter takes an armload of the red broomsticks, and stumbles.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (grabbing at him)
               <u>Hey watch it</u>!

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (grinning)
               It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop
               it.

     They begin to carry the explosives up the steps.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDOR</u>

     The three men are carrying their equipment along the hallway, when
     Hunter's tracker suddenly BEEPS.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Hold it!

     They all stop.  The tracker BEEPS AGAIN.  Hunter puts down his stuff and
     points the tracker around.

<b>                              HUNTER (CONT'D)
</b>                    (nodding up some steps)
               Up there.

     They all look at each other.  Standard puts down his bundle and picks
     up the flamethrower.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               So what do we do?  Do we ignore it
               and finish loading the explosives
               into the boat -- or do we flush it
               out now?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Now.  If we can get it into the boat,
               we won't have to blow it up -- we
               can just eject it into space.

     Standard hefts the flamethrower and starts up the steps.

     <u>INTERIOR - DIM STAIRWELL</u>

     Standard's face is tense as he advances up the circular steps.
     Suddenly, a METALLIC TAPPING SOUND is heard.  He freezes.

     Then he continues up.

     <u>EXTERIOR - DORSAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE</u>

     The view of interstellar space is spectacular.  As Standard comes up
     the steps, the METALLIC TAPPING is heard again.

     Standard looks around.  Then he sees it -- BROUSSARD'S CORPSE FLOATS
     OUTSIDE THE GLASS OF THE DOME.  It is tangled in some rigging, and the
     movement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glass
     periodically.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (shouts)
               You can come up!  It's safe!

     The others come up the steps.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (spying the corpse)
               Oh -- Jesus --

     Broussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn
     loose.  Bumping against the glass, he looks like he wants to come in.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               The ship's gravitational attraction
               must have drawn him back.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>                    (horrified)
               Should we go outside and bring him
               in?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps
               after we've destroyed the thing.

     Glancing back, the men retreat from the observation dome.  Broussard
     remains against the glass, peering in with dead eyes.

     <u>INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP</u>

     The floor slopes upward slightly here as the corridor funnels in and
     ends in the entrance to a narrow passageway or crawl-way.  This
     passageway connects the nose of the ship with the lifeboat.

     The three men come up to the entrance to the passageway, carrying the
     equipment.  They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat.

     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     The passageway connects into the rear of the lifeboat.  It is an
     extremely simple, stripped-down vehicle; even the metal struts and
     beams-are exposed.  A single hypersleep freezer takes up a fair amount
     of floor space.  It is an escape-craft, nothing more.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (pointing)
               Along the base of the walls there.

     They begin to stack the red broomsticks against the base of the walls
     on both sides of the lifeboat, and to wire them into position tightly.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               This should do it.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               I should hope so!  And we'd better
               make sure it's pretty far from the
               ship when we blow it.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               It will be.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>                    (surveys the craft uneasily)
               What we really need is some red meat
               in here for bait.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Well, if we had some, I'd eat it.
               I'm starting to get hungry.

     By this time, they are exiting.

     <u>INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP</u>

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Well... now we have to herd that
               thing up here.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>                    (nervously)
               Whoever's doing the herding is gonna
               have their hands pretty full.  I
               think somebody should stay by the
               lifeboat to slam the door on the
               thing once it's inside, and to serve
               as... as... 
                    (searches for a word)

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Isn't "bait" the word you used?

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Hey look, somebody has to have his
               hands free to lock the creature in
               the lifeboat!

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Yes, and maybe launch the boat and
               blow it too... if the others are
               injured.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Who gets the privilege?

     INSERT: THREE CRUMPLED PIECES OF PAPER.  Three hands pick them up.

     ANGLE ON ROBY.  He unfolds his paper, turns it so the others can see
     it.  It has a big X on it.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - SHORTLY LATER.  Hunter is showing Roby a small device
     like a transistor radio.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               Just keep your finger off the button
               till she's way away from the ship,
               that's all.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Is it armed?

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               If you press the button right now,
               it will blow the whole nose of the
               ship off.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Thanks for the thought.
                    (puts detonator in his
                     breast pocket)

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               All right, Martin, we'll be in touch
               with you on the communicator.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               And you'll let me know when you've
               got it coming this way... 

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               And you stand aside while we drive
               it in, then shut the hatch, launch
               the boat, and --

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Kablooey.

     Hunter's face twitches nervously at this.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Come on; we haven't much time, air
               is a factor.

     They leave the nose of the ship, Standard carrying the flamethrower,
     Hunter the tracker.

     Roby settles himself at the controls, runs through them briefly to
     familiarize himself.  Using a switch, he opens and closes the lifeboat
     door a couple of times.  It slams open and shut quite rapidly.

     He presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to "READY."

     Then STANDARD'S VOICE comes from the communicator:

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (over, filtered)
               We've got something on the
               tracker... got to be it, it's
               too big for the cat.

     This is a VERY SPOOKY SCENE, ROBY ALONE BY THE LIFEBOAT, LISTENING TO
<b>     THE VOICES ON THE COMMUNICATOR.
</b>
<b>                              HUNTER
</b>                    (over, filtered)
               It's coming from down there.

     Roby hears various tinny sound effects, rustlings, clunkings,
     breathing, etc.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDOR IN SHIP</u>

     Standard has the flamethrower at the ready, and Hunter is staring at
     the tracker.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               It must have stopped moving.  I'm not
               getting anything.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Let me go first; you stay behind me.

     Carefully, Standard advances down the corridor.  Then THE CREATURE POPS
     OUT OF HIDING <u>BEHIND</u> HUNTER, AND PICKS HIM UP.

<b>     HUNTER SCREAMS.
</b>
     Standard whirls around, sees the thing clutching Hunter.  It holds him
     off to one side, as though to keep Standard from getting at him.

     Standard doesn't know what to do.

<b>                              HUNTER
</b>               The flamethrower!

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               I can't, the acid will pour out!

     At that moment the creature TAKES A BITE OUT OF HUNTER, WHO SCREAMS IN
<b>     MORTAL AGONY.
</b>
     Standard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fires
<b>     -- BUT THE CREATURE SWINGS HUNTER AROUND AS A SHIELD AND HUNTER
</b><b>     CATCHES THE FULL BLAST OF THE FLAME.
</b>
     Standard instantly stops firing, but now Hunter is a kicking ball of
     flame, held out at arm's length by the monster.

     <u>INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP</u>

     Roby is listening to all this on the communicator.  He can hear the
     shrieks and crashing noises.

     Then the communicator goes dead, and all he hears is a rush of static.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Hello?  Standard?  Hunter?

     He waits quite a while for a response, but we can see from his
     expression that he expects none.

     He drops his face into his hands.  When he lifts his head again, he has
     managed to summon a certain amount of resolve.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP</u>

     Roby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the other
     hand.  He comes across Standard's flamethrower, lying on the floor.  He
     picks it up, substituting it for the pistol.

     Then he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the steps
     into the maintenance level.

     <u>INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL</u>

     Roby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that
     the source of the signal is directly under his feet.  Looking down, he
     sees that he is standing on a square metal plate.

     Getting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate,
     revealing a black opening with a ladder going down.

     Substituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying the
     flamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder.

     <u>INTERIOR - DARK STORAGE ROOM</u>

     Shining the light around into the darkness, Roby descends the metal
     ladder to the floor.

<b>     THE PLACE IS A HORRIBLE LAIR, FULL OF BONES, HAIR, SHREDS OF FLESH,
</b><b>     PIECES OF CLOTHING, AND SHOES.
</b>
     Something moves in the darkness -- Roby turns his light on it.

     HANGING FROM THE CEILING IS A HUGE COCOON.  It appears to be woven from
     some fine, white, silk-like material, and it is slowly undulating.

     Flamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon.  As he gets close
     enough, he sees that the cocoon is semi-transparent and THE BODY OF
<b>     STANDARD IS INSIDE IT.
</b>
     Unexpectedly, Standard's eyes open, and focus on Roby -- who jumps
     violently.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (a feeble whisper)
               Kill me... 

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (sickened)
               What did it do to you?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>                    (moves his head slightly)
               Look... 

     Roby turns his light where Standard indicates.  Another cocoon dangles
     from the ceiling, but this one looks a little different.  It is smaller
     and darker, with a harder shell.  In fact, it looks almost EXACTLY LIKE
<b>     THE SPORES IN THE TOMB.
</b>
<b>                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
</b>                    (whispering)
               That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter... 

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (looking around for a tool)
               I'll get you out of there.

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               No... don't... 

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               But I can save you -- get you to the
               Autodoc!

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               No good... it's eaten too much of
               me... 

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (in horror)
               What can I do?

<b>                              STANDARD
</b>               Kill me... 

     Roby stares at him in horror, then bends down and takes a closer look
     at him.  REACTING, he straightens back up, raises the flamethrower, and
     sprays a molten blast.  When the entire room is in flames, he turns and
     scrambles back up the ladder.

     <u>INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL</u>

     Roby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up.
     At length, he regains control of himself.

     <u>EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE - AT LIGHT SPEED</u>

     The SNARK appears to hang motionless, with planets and star clusters
     rolling past in the infinite distance.

     <u>INTERIOR - BRIDGE</u>

     Roby is putting the cat into a metal, vacuum-sealed catbox, with a
     little oxygen tank on it.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Kitty go bye-bye.

     He seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen.  There is a faint hiss
     of pressurized air.  Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window in
     front.  It YOWLS.

     He picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge.

     <u>INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY</u>

     Carrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course the
     flamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal
     cannisters.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (reading from labels)
               What'll it be, Kitty?  Here -- how
               about some Tacitum-35, ten kilos of
               it.  This'll buy us an island on some
               nice planet.

     Putting the invaluable cannister into the shoulder bag, he hurries
     back up the steps.

     <u>INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM</u>

     Catbox in one hand, flamethrower in the other, Roby enters the engine
     room, containing the massive stardrive engines.

     He puts down his parcels and approaches the main control board for the
     engines.  Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, one
     by one.

<b>     A SIREN BEGINS TO HONK THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.
</b>
<b>                              COMPUTER
</b>               Attention!  The cooling units for the
               stardrive engines are not
               functioning!  Engines will overload
               in 4 minutes, 50 seconds!  Attention!

     Finally Roby closes the last switch.  Shaking with nervousness, he
     hurriedly picks up catbox, bag and flamethrower and hurries out of the
     engine room.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP</u>

     Roby hurries on, listening to the siren.

<b>                              COMPUTER
</b>               Attention!  Engines will overheat and
               main core will melt in 4 minutes, 30
               seconds!

     <u>INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP</u>

     Roby comes hustling up to where the lifeboat is berthed.  Hands full,
     he starts to enter the connecting passageway.

     <u>INTERIOR - CONNECTING PASSAGEWAY</u>

<b>     THE CREATURE IS WAITING AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGEWAY, INSIDE THE
</b><b>     LIFEBOAT.
</b>
     It HISSES and starts toward him.

     <u>INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP</u>

     Roby leaps out of the passageway, bounds to the controls, and throws
     the switch.  The hatch door SLAMS SHUT, locking the thing in the
     lifeboat.

<b>                              COMPUTER
</b>               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               4 minutes!

     Indecisive, Roby stares at the lifeboat "LAUNCH" button.  The thing can
     be heard fumbling around in the passageway.

     Finally, he turns and bolts back toward the engine room.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP</u>

     Like a maniac, Roby runs through the ship, level after level, pounding
     down stairwells, his footsteps clanging metallically throughout the
     ship as he sprints for the engine room.

<b>                              COMPUTER
</b>               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               3 minutes, 30 seconds!

     <u>INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM</u>

     The door crashes open and Roby comes running in.  The room is full of
     smoke and the engines are whining dangerously.  It is extremely hot in
     the room; Roby instantly breaks out in sweat.

     He runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling unit
     switches.

     Still THE SIREN CONTINUES.

<b>                              COMPUTER
</b>               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               3 minutes!

     Roby pushes a button and speaks into it.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Computer!  I've turned all the
               cooling units back on!  What's wrong?

<b>                              COMPUTER
</b>               The reaction has proceeded too far.
               The core has begun to melt.  Engines
               will overload in 2 minutes, 35
               seconds.

     A look of terror comes onto Roby's face.  He turns and runs from the
     engine room.

     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP</u>

     Again, Roby must run through all the levels of the ship, this time
     <u>up</u> the stairs, exhausted, stumbling, while the computer counts down:

<b>                              COMPUTER
</b>               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               2 minutes!

     <u>INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP</u>

     Reeling, gasping for breath, Roby staggers into the vestibule where
     the lifeboat is berthed.  He grabs the flamethrower and turns it toward
     the passageway.

     It is then he realizes that THE LIFEBOAT DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN.

     Quickly, he glances around to see if the creature might be behind him.
     Then he advances on the passageway.

     <u>INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY</u>

     Dripping with sweat, his face a mask of fear, Roby enters the
     passageway, flamethrower gripped tightly in his hands.  He is goaded on
     by the siren and the computer:

<b>                              COMPUTER
</b>               Attention!  Engines will explode in
               90 seconds!

     He makes it all the way to the end of the passageway, then sticks his
     head into the lifeboat.

     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     HIS POINT-OF-VIEW as he quickly scans the lifeboat, reveals that it is
<b>     EMPTY.
</b>
     <u>INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY</u>

     Immediately, he turns and dashes back to the head of the passageway.
     There he grabs the catbox and bag, then runs back into the lifeboat.

<b>                              COMPUTER
</b>               Attention!  Engines will explode in
               60 seconds!

     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     He comes in on the run, hurls the catbox and bag toward the front, and
     does a dive over the back of the control chair.  He is no sooner in the
     seat than he hits the "LAUNCH" button.

     <u>EXTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPACE</u>

     The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE
<b>     LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE "SNARK."
</b>
     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates
     away from the mother ship.

     <u>EXTERIOR - SPACE</u>

     The tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of
     the SNARK.  The scene is strangely serene for such deadly
     circumstances.

     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     Roby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the
     catbox.  The cat is YOWLING.  Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches
     his head down over it.

     <u>EXTERIOR - SPACE</u>

     The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind,
     until it is barely a point of light.

<b>     THEN IT BLOWS UP.
</b>
<b>     AN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALL
</b><b>     DIRECTIONS.
</b>
     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     The shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling
     everything inside.  Then all is quiet.

     Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of
     the lifeboat.  He stares out through the porthole.  His face is bathed
     in orange light.

     <u>EXTERIOR - SPACE</u>

     What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away
     into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past.

     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     Roby's expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of
     his ship and friends.

<b>     BEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEEN
</b><b>     INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG.
</b>
     The cat SCREECHES.

     Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of
     the boat.  It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man's arm.

     It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby.

     His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on
     the floor right next to the monster.  Next he glances around for any
     place to hide.  His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit,
     with the door standing open.

     He begins to edge toward the locker.  The creature rises.  He freezes.

     It throws down the arm.  With that, Roby dives for the open locker
     door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut.

     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>

     There is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face
     right up to the glass, peering in at Roby.  The locker is so small that
     Roby's face is only inches away from the creature's.  The sight is
     disgusting.  It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity.

     Then the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it.

     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     The creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits.  It
     bends down and peers inside.  The CAT YOWLS LOUDER.

     It picks up the catbox in its tentacles.

     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>

     Trying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THE
<b>     GLASS.
</b>
     But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the
     glass, startling the hell out of Roby.

     Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the
     catbox.

     Roby looks around.  He spies the spacesuit.  Quickly, he begins to pull
     it on.

     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     The creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see
     if there is anything inside.  The cat MOANS.

     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>

     Roby is halfway into the pressure suit.

     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     The creature throws the catbox down.  It clangs, and bounces.  The thing
     picks it up again and hammers it against the wall.  Then it jams it
     into a crevice in the wall.

     With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the
     crevice.  The cat has gone beyond hysterics.

     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>

     Roby pulls on the helmet, latches it into place, then turns on the
     oxygen.  With a hiss, the suit fills itself.

     In a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip.
     Roby peels the rubber off, revealing a sharp steel point.

     Again he raps on the glass.

     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     The creature turns.  It faces the locker, peers at him.

     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>

<b>                              ROBY
</b>               Try a little of this, you fucking
               bastard.

<b>     HE KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.
</b>
     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     The creature rises, but just in time to catch THE STEEL SHAFT RIGHT
<b>     THROUGH ITS MIDRIFF.
</b>
     IT MAKES A HORRIBLE NOISE AND CLUTCHES AT THE SPUR.  The yellow acid
     begins to flow from the wound.

     Before the acid can touch the floor, Roby reaches back and pulls a
     switch -- BLOWING THE REAR HATCH.

     In a poof, the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into
     space -- and the bleeding creature along with it.  Roby grabs a steel
     strut to keep from being sucked out, but as the creature passes him IT
<b>     WRAPS THE END OF A TENTACLE AROUND HIS ANKLE.
</b>

     <u>EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE</u>

     Roby is now hanging halfway out of the lifeboat, with the thing
     clinging to his leg.  He kicks at it with his free foot, but it won't
     let go.

     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     Looking for any salvation, Roby grabs the hatch control lever and
     yanks it.

     The hatch slams shut, closing Roby safely inside but TRAPPING THE END
<b>     OF THE CREATURE'S TENTACLE IN THE DOORJAMB.
</b>
     It instantly releases Roby, who staggers back.

     <u>EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE</u>

     The creature is now outside the lifeboat, in the vacuum, squirming,
     the tip of its tentacle caught in the closed hatch.

     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     Where the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is
     starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal.

     Roby stumbles forward to the controls and pushes a lever labeled:

<b>                              "RAM JETS"
</b>
     <u>EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE</u>

     The jet exhausts are located at the rear of the craft, right where the
     creature is wriggling.  THE ENGINES BELCH FLAME FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN
<b>     SHUT OFF.
</b>
<b>     INCINERATED, THE CREATURE TUMBLES SLOWLY AWAY INTO SPACE.
</b>
     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>

     Roby hurries to the rear hatch and looks out after the thing.

     <u>EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE</u>

     The burned mass of the monster drifts slowly away into space, a
     writhing, smoking, foaming mass.

     As it tumbles into the distance, pieces drop off it -- it bloats --
     then bursts, soggily, sending a spray of particles off in all
     directions.  The last we see of it is a few smouldering rags, dwindling
     into infinity.

<b>                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - LATER</u>

     The boat is re-pressurized and Roby is seated in the control chair.  He
     seems calm and composed, almost cheerful.  The cat purrs in his lap.

<b>                              ROBY
</b>                    (dictating)
               ... So it looks like I'll make it
               back to the Colonies on schedule
               after all.  I should be to the
               frontier in another 250 years or so,
               and then with a little luck the
               network will pick me up.  I'm not as
               rich as I was a couple days ago --
               but I'm not exactly broke either.
               Incidentally, I did manage to
               salvage one souvenir out of this
               whole mess.

     He reaches down into the carrying bag he brought on board, and pulls
     out the ALIEN SKULL.

<b>                              ROBY (CONT'D)
</b>               Poor Yorick here should go at least
               partway toward proving I'm not a
               crank.  I wish it was him we'd met in
               the first place -- things might have
               turned out different.

     He puts the skull down on a shelf and locks a glass lid over it.

<b>                              ROBY (CONT'D)
</b>               This is Martin Roby, executive

               Come on, cat, let's go to sleep.

     Roby leans forward and switches off the recorder.  Then he rises and,
     carrying the cat, walks to the hypersleep freezer, which stands open.

     He climbs in and stretches out on his back, holding the cat against
     his chest.  With one hand, he presses a switch, and THE LID CLOSES OVER
<b>     HIM.
</b>
     CLOSE-UP OF THE ALIEN SKULL, watching sentinel over the slumbering
     Roby like some dead, melancholy pixie.

     <u>EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE</u>

     The lifeboat -- SNARK 2 -- sails away toward its rendezvous with Irth,
     250 years from now.

     As SNARK 2 drifts past camera, we suddenly see that A SPORE POD IS
<b>     ADHERED TO THE UNDERBELLY OF THE CRAFT.
